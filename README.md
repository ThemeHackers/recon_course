# 🕵️ Recon Course

- This project will demonstrate how to use the tools in ProjectDiscovery to efficiently investigate bug bounties.
- This tool is automated, it doesn't mean it's the most efficient, you should do it manually to get better results, but this automation is just my workflow.
## 📦 Install Tools

```bash

chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh

```

## 📖 Text-based help messages
```bash

chmod +x hc_tools_txt.sh
./hc_tools_txt.sh

## 💻 Request CLI help

## 🚀 Initiation of deployment and reconnaissance

## 📌 Notes
